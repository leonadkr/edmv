This program renames list of input files using an external editor.
The editor can be determined by the command line argument -e or --editor, by name or path in config file '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.edmv/config' or by value of $VISUAL or $EDITOR, in this order.

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.edmv/config is a text file and looks like:
	[Main]
	editor = nano

Be aware: the program overwrites the files!

The program uses glib, also you need cmake to build it.

To build:
cmake -S edmv -B edmv/build --preset release
cmake --build edmv/build

To install:
cmake --install edmv/build --prefix edmv/install
