This program renames list of input files using an external editor.
The editor can be determined by the command line argument -e or --editor, by name or path in config file '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.edmv/config' or by value of $VISUAL or $EDITOR, in this order.

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.edmv/config is a text file and looks like:
	[Main]
	editor = nano

Be aware: the program overwrites the files!

The program uses glib, also you need cmake to build it.

To build:
cmake -S edmv -B /tmp/edmv/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=GlibToolChain.cmake

To install:
DESTDIR=$HOME/.local cmake --build /tmp/edmv/release --config Release --target install
